I guess the scan above gives it away but I can finally release the news that we are going to be having another baby!

 It's due next February and will increase the [RoysWorld](http://roysworld.co.uk) clan to five including me and P. As well as the usual spell of nest making, we are looking at which new car would be suitable for carrying us all.
Billy had a dream (before we told him) that he had a new baby sister, so it remains to see whether his prediction of its sex is correct.
