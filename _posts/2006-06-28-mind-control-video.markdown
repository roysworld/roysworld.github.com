![Derren Brown](http://sjl-static11.sjl.youtube.com/vi/0tuPVJk0a8A/2.jpg)Further to my [post](http://roysworld.co.uk/?p=2771)  about the Derren Brown tribute album [Inside Your Ears](http://www.insideyourears.co.uk/), they have [released a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tuPVJk0a8A) for their song Mind Control. It's quite funny. Even funnier though is the [full length show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhj5UZ0tv1E&search=derren%20brown) the video is taken from.
