title: Cure For Hiccups
---
The other night Billy had hiccups. <br /><br />We tried the usual cures of 'making him jump' and 'holding your breath' when Billy said "I have just invented a cure for hiccups".<br />"OK" I said "What is it?"<br />"Count up to 10 but shout the number 10"<br />"Go on then"<br />"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, TEN!" <br /><br />Guess what. It worked.<br /><br />Over the weekend both Billy and Paula had the hiccups and this cure worked first time. So if you ever get hiccups count to ten and shout the last number and thank Billy for his foolproof cure for hiccups.<br />
