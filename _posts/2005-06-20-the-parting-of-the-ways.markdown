title: The Parting of the Ways
---
Saturday nights Dr Who was brilliant;Billy and I sat open mouthed at the whole episode. OK, it did have faults. Frankly the whole Bad Wolf thing was a bit of a let down, and 'Exorcist Rose' exterminating the Daleks was a bit of a cop out too, but the regeneration more than made up for it. I also like the bit when the Dalek appeared at the window, we couldn't hear him, but his lights 'mouthed' exterminate. Brilliant.<br /><br />I assumed that a lot of the detail went over Billy's head, until I heard him talking through the fence to Ben next door: "Oh, and the TARDIS is a living thing as well as a spaceship, and Rose is Bad Wolf because she looked into the TARDIS. Wolf backwards is Flow, so it's Bad Flow as well as Bad Wolf." Blimey, five year olds really are information sponges. <br /><br />Roll on the next series.
