After Sunday nights final Live show with Derek Acorah, the new series of Most Haunted started last night with new medium Gordon Smith. Now I've heard of him before, he was followed around on the BBC documentary ["Mediums: Talking to the Dead"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/09_september/17/mediums.shtml) and he has a good reputation in the spiritualist arena. As you know, I don't believe in any of this psychic medium stuff, but he was certainly the most convincing in the documentary. He refers to himself as the ['Psychic Barber'](http://www.thepsychicbarber.co.uk) as he began speaking to the dead whilst working at a hairdressers (and I don't just mean the old ladies wanting a blue rinse). In this first episode him and [David Wells](http://www.davidwells.co.uk/index2.html) got on like a house on fire; mincing around some haunted house in Exeter. They were backing each other up rather than competing and reminded me of of an overweight psychic [Colin and Justin](http://www.knightayton.co.uk/justin_colin.html). Both Gordon and David ended up in some sort of a trance whilst being possessed by a ghost with a long drawn out spooky face (who said Derek has left). Nothing on [Bad Psychics](http://www.badpsychics.co.uk/) about Gordon as yet, but my guess is it's only a matter of time now that his profile has been raised. Move over Derek, there's a new guy in town. If you're interested, Gordon has written a couple of books: [Spirit Messenger](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000645DD/roysworld0e-21) and [The Unbelievable Truth.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401905498/roysworld0e-21)
