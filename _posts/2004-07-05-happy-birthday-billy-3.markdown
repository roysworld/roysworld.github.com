title: Happy Birthday Billy
---
Today is Billys fifth birthday so  Happy Birthday Billy.rn<br /><br />Yesterday we had a Red Indian themed birthday party and he had 10 of his friends came (Molly, Eleanor, [Edward](http://thebloomers.blogspot.com/2004/06/happy-birthday-edward.html "Edward"), Joe, Conor, James C, Charlie, Ben, James E and Stephen).rnIt was great fun. We started by making head-dresses and applying face paint, moving on to building four tipis out of garden canes and cut up dustsheets. They looked really great and the kids loved huddling up in twos and threes inside them. Other activities were "pin the feather on the indian", panning for gold (actually it was gold pyrite but everyone was fooled), making a campfire (with twigs and tissue), building totem poles, and a treasure hunt. Eleanor had the closest feather, and Joe collected the most gold - so both won prizes. I managed to find some real audio native American music that was broadcasted into the garden and the kids loved eating their hotdogs and chips around the campfire. It rained a bit but we had a big gazebo to keep everyone dry and put it down to the kids doing a raindance. Thanks to everyone who came.rn<br /><br />Billy was at school this morning, but came home at lunchtime and had a great time opening all of his presents. There are too many to mention, but special thanks to Molly and Ben who both bought magic themed presents giving Billy his first steps into becoming a magician courtesy of [Marvin's Magic](http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=134&awinaffid=45161&clickref=BB&p=http://www.magictricks.co.uk/prodlist.asp?cat=marvin "Marvin's Magic") We spent the afternoon sliding down his new waterslide in the garden and rapidly switching between his new toys, never spending more than 5 minutes playing with each.
