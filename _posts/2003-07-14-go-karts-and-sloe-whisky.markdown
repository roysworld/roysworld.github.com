title: Go-karts and Sloe Whisky
---
Last weekend we visited Molly's grandparents in Wales. They live in a lovely house on the edge of [Llangorse Lake](http://www.brecon-beacons.com/llangorse-lake.htm). It has a brilliant garden that the kids loved playing in, and we all had a fabulous time. <br /><br />Saturday afternoon we went to a hot air balloon display, and Billy and Molly had their first proper go-kart race. Billy seemed a natural at overtaking by cutting up the car in front and forcing them out on the bends. They both did a grand job at entertaining the masses resulting in them being allowed to stay on in return for a couple of lager shandies.<br /><br />We had planned to do a spot of trout fishing, but in the end ran out of time. Billy, of course, was still adamant that we went fishing on the lake; so we headed off with bamboo canes, lengths of string and two safety pins. The only bait we had were a couple of raisins, and needless to say the fish weren't particularly interested. This didn't matter to Billy who was quite happy catching 'seaweed' and was convinced he had in fact caught the raisin after forgetting we put it on in the first place.<br /><br />All in all a wonderful weekend and thanks to Roger and Roseanne for their generous hospitality (and of course summer pudding and sloe whisky).
