![Derren Brown](http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/images/artwork/thumbs/54.jpg "Derren Brown")<br /><br />[Derren Brown's own website](http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk) has also undergone some changes, so check it out for [news](http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/news) on the tour and new series. <br />You can also [buy](http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/pictures/gallery/artwork) limited edition original Derren Brown artwork like the one above and he also has a post showing [how his picture of Cate Blanchett came together](http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/pictures/gallery/artwork_making_of). 50 quid for a signed piece seems like pretty good value to me.
