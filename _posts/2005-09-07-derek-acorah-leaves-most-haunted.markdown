title: Derek Acorah Leaves Most Haunted
---
So it's official, Derek Acorah is to leave Most Haunted to work on his new series [Ghost Towns](http://roysworld.co.uk/?p=2747). I can't say I'm totally surprised. If anyone read the Heat magazine interview with Derek and Yvette Fielding it was pretty obvious that they no longer get on at all, and she wasn't going to leave. I guess this is the end of an era, the show will never be the same again, I just wonder if Derek saw it all coming?
