title: derren's scary website
---
Derren Brown has produced an alternative version of his website. It is visually stunning, and in places quite disturbing. It is a pretty interesting way to present a website, and goes against everything usability guys go on and on about. Navigation is particularly unclear, but this gives the whole site an almost game-like quality. Loads of spooky sounds and subliminal images keep popping up all over the place. I really like it. Now go and [check it out](http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/?flash=yes) - NOTE gratuitous use of Flash.
