title: Sorcerers Apprentice
---
Billy and me are really enjoying the Sorcerer's Apprentice on BBC1. The premise is that 14 apprentices are taught the art of magic by magician Max Somerset, whittling them down to a single apprentice by the end of the series. [Sanders the Great](http://sandersthegreat.co.uk) has a good [set of reviews](http://www.sandersthegreat.co.uk/tag/sorcerers+apprentice) of the series for you to enjoy.
