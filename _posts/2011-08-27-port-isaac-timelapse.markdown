We have just returned from a brilliant fortnight in Port Isaac. I was playing around with an Android [timelapse app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tina.time_lapse) and took images of our walk from the holiday cottage to the [Platt](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=port+isaac&hl=en&ll=50.592603,-4.832557&spn=0.002762,0.004823&sll=50.554552,-4.884428&sspn=0.176902,0.308647&vpsrc=6&t=h&z=18).
