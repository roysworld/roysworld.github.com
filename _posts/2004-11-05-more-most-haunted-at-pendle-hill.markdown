title: More Most Haunted at Pendle Hill
---
The [Clitheroe Advertiser and Times](http://www.clitheroetoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=9&ArticleID=883121) has a good article/review on the most recent Most Haunted Live at Pendle Hill. <br /><br />Apparently <i>"Millions of people tuned in with the final hour of the Hallowe'en show being the most watched programme in the whole of the UK"</i>. <br /><br />Wow. I'm not suprised at the viewing figures it was very entertaining TV. And to their question: <i>"Do you believe now?"</i> my response is "No".
