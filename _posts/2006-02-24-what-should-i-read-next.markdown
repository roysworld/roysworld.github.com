title: What Should I Read Next?
---
Just enjoyed reading a book, and don't know what to read next? Try [www.whatshouldireadnext.com](http://www.whatshouldireadnext.com). It uses readers recommendations to suggest books you might like based upon author and a title.I tried it out with two of my favourite books: Iain Banks' [The Wasp Factory](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349101779/roysworld0e-21) and Christopher Priest's [The Prestige](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575075805/roysworld0e-21). Both gave a selection of other titles I might like to try, and at first glance they look quite promising. It did, however, recommend [Jamie's Italy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0718147707/roysworld0e-21) for readers of [The Wasp Factory](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349101779/roysworld0e-21) which seems a little off topic to say the least. Do the readers know something about Jamie Oliver hidden from the rest of us?
