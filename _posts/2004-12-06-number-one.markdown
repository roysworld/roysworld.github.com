![Dave](http://www.flickr.com/photos/1492632_a06d9fffc2_m.jpg "Dave")<br />[Dave](http://whathafu.blogspot.com) has the dubioius honour of being the first to donate to "I Want An iPod". I must also mention that he was the catalyst of this very concept, so thanks a lot Dave. His song choice is Orphans by Deacon Blue. [Read Dave's blog here.](http://whathafu.blogspot.com)<br /><br />Only 499 donations to go.
