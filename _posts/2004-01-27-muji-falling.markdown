title: Muji Falling
---
We were in Reading at the weekend and we popped into [Muji](http://www.muji.co.uk/) to have a browse. In the window they had a fantastically intricate display consisting of several dozen perspex cubes each filled with green ping-pong balls. <br /><br />Billy walked into it...<br /><br />The display crashed to the floor. Ping-pong balls by the thousand rolled off in every direction. The noise was deafening. When everything was still, a friendly shop assistant in a brown apron came over to see if we were OK, and they were fine about it. Guilt forced us to buy several items, and we ended up being in there for about half an hour. As we left the door the shop assistant was still filling boxes - and from the look on her face she was going to be there some time.
