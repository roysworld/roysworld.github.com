title: Lego Space Invaders

Whilst playing lego with Billy yesterday I thought it would be cool to create a reproduction of a space invaders screen out of lego. We made a couple of prototypes and I thought the project would be a good one to blog about. I checked on the internet to see if anyone else had had MY idea - and of course someone has. [This guy](http://www.berkhirt.com/lego-space-invaders/space.html) has started creating one, and has realised it would be about 6ft by 8ft and has decided to scale the image to 'lego resolution'. His project is not yet complete, but he is listing the parts required and so is one to watch (for me anyway!).

Maybe I should do PacMan...

Here are some images:
