title: Grenade Potato
---
I spotted this news [link](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/italy_grandmother_grenade_dc) today telling a tale of "a 74-year-old Italian grandmother who bought a sack of potatoes at the her local market (and) found a live grenade among the spuds.". Now I've seen this headline loads of times over the years. It's always blamed on remnants of WW2 activities. I'm convinced it's an urban legend that resurfaces when there's no real news about. I'm going to do some searching...
