It's the 100th anniversary of Ted 'Seuss' Geisel - one of Billy favourite authors. Some titbits from [Yahoo! News](http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/entertainment/*http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/usatoday/20040302/en_bo_usatoday/whywelovedrseussinafewwords) are:<br /><br />"Seuss - his middle name and his mother&rsquo;s maiden name - rhymes with &#8220;voice,&#8221; ... rather than &#8220;loose.&#8221;<br />He invented the word 'nerd'.<br />"Green Eggs and Ham" was written when he was bet $50 by Random House publisher Bennet Cerf that he couldn't write a book using only 50 words.
