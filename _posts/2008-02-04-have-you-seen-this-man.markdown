title: Have You Seen This Man

![Robber](http://www.pinktentacle.com/images/faceless_robber.jpg)
The Royal Thai Police have released this rather unhelpful sketch of a man suspected of stealing 200,000 baht from the Ladprao branch of the Government Savings Bank (GSB) in Bangkok several weeks ago.

The sketch is based on the recollections of eyewitnesses, who say the suspect wore a motorcycle helmet at the time of the robbery.

Do let [them](http://www.newsclip.be/news/2008129_017475.html) know if you've seen him. [[Courtesy of Pink Tentacle]](http://www.pinktentacle.com/2008/02/police-sketch-faceless-bank-robber-thailand/)
