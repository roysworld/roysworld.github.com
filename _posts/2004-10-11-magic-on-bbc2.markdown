title: Magic on BBC2
---
Next Saturday at 8:10 on BBC2 there is the start of a new six part series tracing the history of magic; here's what they say:<br /><br />"The definitive guide to the history of Performance Magic from Ancient Egypt to 21st century Las Vegas, and why it has played such an important role in our social and cultural history." <br /><br />The first episode looks interesting:<br /><br />"Prepare to be amazed by mind reading illusions which seem to defy rational explanation. From the oracle of Delphi, through the age of Spiritualism, to today's psychological trickster, Derren Brown, it also features a modern version of a mind trick which mystified millions of British radio listeners in the 1950's."<br /><br />I can't wait.
