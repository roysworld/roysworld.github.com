![](http://roysworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d11s02e08_wallpaper_20-300x206.jpg "AmyDoctorRory")In Doctor Who on Saturday ("Let's Kill Hitler") we sat down as a family to watch. The Doctor got into a chat with the robotic Amy thingy and the following dialog took place:Amy Robot Thingy: _"The Silence is not a species; it is a religious order or movement. Their core belief is that silence will fall when the question is asked."_Doctor: _"What question?"_Amy Robot Thingy: _"The first question; the oldest question in the universe. Hidden in plain sight"._Doctor: _"Yes, but what is the question?"_At which point we looked at each other all a little bemused. All of us that is except Billy. He said: "Well it's obvious isn't it...? The question is 'Who?'".Brilliant. He's a smart little bugger isn't he?
