[![Excel Space Invaders](http://www1.plala.or.jp/chikada/vba/cellvader/cellvader_m.jpg "Excel Space Invaders")](http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/)<br /><br />[Some guy in Japan](http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/) has written some Excel macros that allow you to play pacman and space invaders in your spreadsheet presumably whilst filling out your tax return. Why do I find this so disturbing?
