This cool device is in beta, and when complete will be a clever wireless clock that picks up information from Google Calendar. It is designed at a glance to tell you key metrics such as "how long to my next meeting" and "what time does my first meeting start". In the mean time, help them [beta test the software version](https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubRequest?next=http%3A%2F%2Fambientclock.com%2Fambiclock%2Fchoose_calendar&scope=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Ffeeds%2F&session=1&secure=0) or just check out the groovy clock face at [AmbientClock](http://ambientclock.com/)
