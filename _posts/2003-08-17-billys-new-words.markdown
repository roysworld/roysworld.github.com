title: Billys new words
---
Billy is learning words at a seemingly incredible speed - so much so that he appears to pick up what you are saying subconsciously and will then use the phrase himself later. <br />This can be a problem. <br />He overheard Paula dropping something on her foot - and now everytime something bad happens to him he mutters "Oh balls" under his breath. We were in B&Q at the weekend and Billy had been 'altering' the front wheel on Annies 3-wheeler pram. As I lifted it up off the ground the wheel went rolling off into the paint section - speedily followed by Billy shouting "...oh balls, come here silly wheel, oh balls". <br />I'm only glad he didn't overhear me, as I think the language would be a bit stronger.
