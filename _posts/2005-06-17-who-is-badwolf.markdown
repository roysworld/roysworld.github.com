title: Who is Badwolf
---
Billy and I have been hooked on the new series of Doctor Who. I can't wait to see the last episode tomorrow night. The mystery of 'Badwolf' has been interesting; I have, however, found a [picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/grocko/19730424/) of the Rose/Dalek DNA combination - so look if you dare.
