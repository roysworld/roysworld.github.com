Will Storr has published chapter 6 (Me versus Most Haunted) of his Louis Theroux style investigation of the paranormal ["Will Storr vs. The Supernatural"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091901731/roysworld0e-21) on his [MySpace](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=144796382) account.Here is a quick snippet, but do read[read the whole chapter](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=144796382&blogID=215006342) or better still [buy the book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091901731/roysworld0e-21).<blockquote>As the shrill breeze runs through his accurately groomed hair, and multiple diamonds sparkle on his earlobes and fingers, I watch Derek Acorah trying to pre-record a link for his television show. After his fourth fluffing, he gives himself a pantomime slap around the face and says, with a whinny, 'Oh, I can't act!'The crew who are filming Derek and his co-presenter, Yvette Fielding, do not offer any comment. They just remain in position and wait for Yvette to begin, yet again.'Good evening,' she says into the camera, 'and welcome to Most Haunted Live. This is the first night out of three and we're on the hunt for the ghost of the East Anglian witch trials. We're here with the Most Haunted Live crew and, of course, we've got Derek Acorah. Derek, what are you expecting to happen here?''I feel over the next three nights,' he says, in his rich, scouse-with-added-sugar voice, 'you know, it's going to be very eerie.''Ooooh, no,' says Yvette.'Be prepared to be very scared,' Derek says, with his forefinger extended and slamming through the air to give the last two words maximum dramatic impact.'Ooooh, no,' Yvette says again. 'I don't like the sound of that at all. It's going to be amazing.'</blockquote>
