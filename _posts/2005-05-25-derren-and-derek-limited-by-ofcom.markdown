title: Derren and Derek Limited By OfCom
---
Ofcom have just published a single rulebook combining all the existing broadcasting regulations. To this they've added rules "forbidding broadcasters from showing paranormal stunts before the 9pm watershed, or at a time when children may be likely to tune in". According to [The Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1627031,00.html) this means "entertainers who specialise in mind reading and magic like Derren Brown are also likely to be affected", and presumably Derek Acorah types too. I must say I'm slightly baffled by this, what corruption of children's minds are they expecting from a magician 'reading your mind' and telling you the card you picked from his carefully manipulated deck? Does this mean no more 'Geoffrey Durham' on Countdown? If this regulation had applied in the 70s and 80s would it have kept Paul Daniels and Uri Geller from our screens? Ahhh... I'm beginning to see their point.
