Apparently the bearded one has now managed the astounding feat of [absorbing a Jaffa cake with his mind](http://www.seabass7.com/News/ViewStory.cfm?News_Id=206 "absorbing a Jaffa cake with his mind"). <br /><br />This comes courtesy of [Seabass 7](http://www.seabass7.com "Seabass 7") a spoof news stories page that I find quite amusing. The site is in the style of [the Onion](http://www.theonion.com "the Onion") - but is more UK based. It just needs to support RSS and my day will be happier.
