I've just stumbled upon [Bad Psychics](http://www.badpsychics.co.uk); it aims to "...find out the truth, and expose the frauds." There are a couple of sections that prove interesting to Most Haunted fans. First there are a number of faked [orb](http://www.jonscelebworld.com/BadPsychics/FakedOrbPhotos/FakedOrbPhotos.html) and [ghost](http://www.jonscelebworld.com/BadPsychics/FakedGhostPhotos/FakedGhostPhotos.html) photos. Unfortunately none of these are actually very good. <br /><br />More interesting are the sections on Derek Acorah, the [first](http://www.jonscelebworld.com/BadPsychics/PsychicFraud/PsychicFraud-DerekAcorah.html) covering the now infamous "Mary Loves Dick" segment from Most Haunted Live! The article proposes that the section was recorded earlier and not transmitted live, and questions why one of the crew members would say "So does Derek win the 20's then?". It ends with a personal experience of a reader convinced that Derek Acorah is a fraud who used prior knowledge sent in an email within his live show. <br /><br />A [second](http://www.jonscelebworld.com/BadPsychics/PsychicMistakes/PsychicMistakes-DerekAcorah.html) article makes great reading for Most Haunted fans. It documents a number of mistakes Derek Acorah has made throughout the Most Haunted Series' including the claim that the landlord of the Wellington Hotel in Boscastle made up stories to get trade into his pub, and that Derek subsequently channelled information from these ficticious ghosts.
