[![Kreed Kafer TShirt](http://images.cafepress.com/product/21022763_150x150_Front.jpg "null")](http://www.cafepress.com/kreedkafer)<br />Fancy taking the mick out of Mr Acorah. Then [get yourself](http://www.cafepress.com/kreedkafer) a Kreed Kafer = Derek Faker TShirt. They ship in from the US, but with the current exchange rate that's quite cheap. Oh and before you ask, yes they are available in medium.
