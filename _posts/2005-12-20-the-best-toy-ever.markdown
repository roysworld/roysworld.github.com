[![R/C UFO](http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B00067I74I.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00067I74I/roysworld0e-21/026-5322677-8454805)
Billy got one of these [remote control UFO's](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00067I74I/roysworld0e-21/026-5322677-8454805) from his grannie a few weeks back. When I saw it in its box my immediate thought was that it would never work.How wrong was I.This is the toy I always wanted as a kid. It really flies - AND you can control it. OK it takes a bit of getting used to, the initial tendency is to ram it into the ceiling and then ram it into the carpet, but soon you will be hovering like a pro and crying like a girl when the batteries run out. The good news is that with about 5 minutes of charging it's ready to fly again. As you can see, Billy has hardly had a look in!If the man in your life doesn't get one of these for Christmas then you don't love them.
