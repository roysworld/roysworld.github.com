title: Teachers in Supermarkets
---
Billy saw one of his teachers in the supermarket buying food.<br />Billy: "I've just seen Mrs X."<br />Me: "Really, I haven't heard of Mrs X. before. Mrs Y and Z teach you in class 2, so where does Mrs X come in.<br />Billy pauses for a few minutes and says with a look of incredulity "The same door as the other teachers I should imagine."
