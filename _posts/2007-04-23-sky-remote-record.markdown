title: SKY Remote Record
---
I've just discovered [SKY remote record](http://www.sky.com/portal/site/skycom/remoterecord). It allows you to program your Sky+ box either from the web, compatible mobile phone or text. It's really rather good. I've just logged into my [MySky](http://mysky.sky.com/portal/site/skycom/mysky) account, and set [Deal or No Deal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal) to record. It saved me having to go downstairs and more usefully it worked (although I had to go downstairs to check - oh the irony) . Unfortunately my mobile isn't compatible with the service, but I still should be able to record things via text. Technology is a wonderful thing.
