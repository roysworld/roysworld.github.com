Billy: "Dad?"<br />Me: "Yes Son"<br />Billy: "I love you as much as to the moon and back again."<br />Me: "Oh thanks Billy, I love you too."<br />Billy: "I love Mummy as much as to Pluto and back again one thousand times."<br />Me: "Wow that's a lot. Why do you love Mummy so much more?"<br />Billy: "I don't like the look of you."
