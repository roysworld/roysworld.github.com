title: Ackee Ackee 1-2-3
---
We took the kids to the park this weekend and they wanted to play hide and seek. I suggested that we played a game that we called "ackee ackee 1-2-3" when I was at school, but is more commonly know as [kick the can](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_can). We ended up having a great time hiding behind trees and in leaves. Unfortunately when I returned home I realised my hiding out in long grass had resulted in numerous insect bites on my arms and face, and as I always react badly to insect bites, my face feels like it's ballooning even as we speak. Lifehacker had a few ideas as to [how to conquer the itch](http://lifehacker.com/software/outdoors/conquer-your-itchy-mosquito-bite-269569.php), so I may have to get some toothpaste out this afternoon.
