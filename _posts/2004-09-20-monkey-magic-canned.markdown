So Monkey Magic series 2 has been dropped by Five after only 3 episodes. Five say "the series may be rescheduled for a screening later on in the year, or next year". Not too much commitment by them then. I can't say I'm suprised. This news is the most exciting thing that's happened in the series since it started, and is certainly their best disappearing act.
