title: Sticky Students
---
Scientists have developed a [super sticky tape](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2953852.stm "super sticky tape") based upon the hairs found on geckos feet. I just had to laugh at the quote from one of the scientists:<br /><br /><i>"We have also considered producing a large amount of gecko tape - sufficient amounts to enable a student to hang out of a window of a tall building. However it would cost too much money, and would not benefit us scientifically..." <br /></i>
