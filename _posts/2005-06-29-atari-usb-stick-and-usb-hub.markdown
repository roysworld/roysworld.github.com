title: Atari USB stick and USB Hub
---
[Brendan Dawes](http://www.brendandawes.com/) has modded a usb stick (a nice small usb stick) into an old Atari cart to make a rather fetching massive memory stick. I kinda like it:<br /><br />![USB Cart](http://www.brendandawes.com/blog_images/atari_1.jpg "USB Cart")<br /><br />Oh and he's also created a hub out of a joystick...<br /><br />![USB Cart](http://www.brendandawes.com/blog_images/atari_joystick_usb.jpg "USB Cart")<br />
