Fancy running your website off a Commodore 64? Contiki is an [internet enabled operating system and desktop environment for very constrained systems, such as 8-bit homecomputers like the Commodore 64](http://www.dunkels.com/adam/contiki). Apparently it includes a web-server, telnet client and web-browser. Or would you prefer to use an [Atari 800 web server](http://kl.net/atari/)? I feel a mini-project coming on...
