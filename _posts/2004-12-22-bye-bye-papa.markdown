title: Bye Bye Papa
---
Blimey. I've just found out that Peter McCahon died last Wednesday of a massive heart attack. As you probably know, he was 'Papa' in Monkey magic. Now I didn't really like the series very much, but he was my favourite magician of the bunch. He seemed to be the one who actually had some form of charisma. He was only 39.
