title: Who is Daddy
---
Annie was looking through a Saturday magazine today.She spotted a picture of George Clooney, pointed to it, and said "Daddy".I was chuffed and promptly told Paula. 2 minutes later - Annie saw another picture, again pointed to it and said "Daddy". Paula looked, laughed and said it was Linford Christie. To add insult to injury, when she looked more closely it turned out to be P Diddy (or puff daddy or whatever he calls himself now). Kids do NOTHING for your self esteem.
