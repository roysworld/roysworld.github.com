title: eBay's Weird Category
---
I've only just noticed that eBay has a [Weird Items](http://collectables.listings.ebay.co.uk/Weird-Stuff_W0QQfromZR4QQsacategoryZ1466QQsocmdZListingItemList) category. It's definitely worth a look. When I looked today a selection of items up for offer included '5 grams of earth collected from Castle Dracula in Romania', 'a mystery object found in garage', 'a random box of Crap' and a 'limited edition Hannibal Lecturd Turd sculpture'.
