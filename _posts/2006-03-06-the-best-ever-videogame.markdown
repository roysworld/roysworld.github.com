title: The Best Ever Videogame?
---
I've just watched the [video demo](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&q=spore) of Will Wright's (creator of SimCity and the Sims) life simultation [Spore](http://spore.ea.com/). It looks unbelievable. It's a game that simulates the entire evolution of a system, starting at the cellular level through evolving creatures and cities right up to conquest of new Galaxies. The depth of the game looks astonishing, I can hardly wait for this one to hit the shelves, and for someone who rarely plays computer games that's saying something.
