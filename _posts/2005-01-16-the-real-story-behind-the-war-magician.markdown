title: The Real Story Behind The War Magician
---
Richard Stokes has created [maskelynemagic.com](http://www.maskelynemagic.com/) a website "that attempts to unravel the truth behind the wartime career of Jasper Maskelyne." He is not a fan of [David Fisher's "The War Magician"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0297846353/roysworld0e-21) refering to it as an "error-ridden fanciful concoction". I couldn't really comment on that, but the site does offer a wealth of info including some really good [photo's of the dummy tanks](http://www.maskelynemagic.com/mobiledummies194.html) that Jasper created and a large quantity of [articles](http://www.maskelynemagic.com/articles.html) written by Richard.AD37<br />
