title: Multichannel TV Personality of the Year

![Zaphod Beeblebrox](http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=tbn:3KnDiPcbY24J:news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1250000/images/_1252041_hitchhikers_300.jpg "Zaphod Beeblebrox")<br /><br />Yvette Fielding and Derek Acorah have won [Multichannel TV Personality of the Year](http://uk.news.yahoo.com/041205/344/f7y2a.html) at the Variety Club's 52nd Annual Showbusiness Awards. <br /><br />It's weird how they've won it jointly; maybe individually their personalities are seen as being too weak. <br /><br />Strangely, I can't help thinking of an Fielding/Acorah version of Zaphod Beeblebrox.<br /><br />One question remains: Why did Derek look so suprised? Surely Sam would have told him he was going to win beforehand?
