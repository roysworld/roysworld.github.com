title: Rik Eedles == Derek Lies
---
We are currently watching Most Haunted and it's the adverts. Derek Acorah has just mentioned Highwayman Rik Eedles. Myself and Paula instantly thought this must be another anagram. Is it a coincidence that "Rik Eedles" is an anagram of "Derek Lies"? Is this [Kreed Kafer](http://roysworld.co.uk/?tag=kreed+kafer) all over again?
