title: Happy Holidays
---
You may have been wondering (or maybe not) why RoysWorld has been a bit quiet of late. Well for the last 2 weeks we've been on holiday to Cornwall with the kids and our mates Morag, Jonny and Molly. I'm not going to bore you with the web equivalent of a slideshow, but the main highlights were as follows:<br /><br /><li>We stayed [at a really nice farm](http://www.theoldehouse.co.uk/ "The Olde House") near Wadebridge. It has fantastic facilities for the kids, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting self catering in the area.</li><br /><li>Me and Jonny had a brilliant morning [mackerel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A639092 "mackerel") fishing. Jonny caught 6 and I caught 5 and a [gurnard](http://www.sea-angling-ireland.org/gurnard%20-%20red.htm "gurnard") (for which I was told off by the skipper for angling too deep). They tasted great on the barbie.</li><br /><li>Billy had an incident with a tube slide resulting in an afternoon in Bodmin casualty (just bruising in the end).</li><br /><li>Brilliant nosh ups at [The Maltsters Arms](http://www.chycor.co.uk/restaurants/maltsters/maltsters.htm "The Maltsters Arms").</li><br /><li>Rock-pooling and building of sandcastles at Polzeath.</li><br /><li>Cycling along the [Camel Trail](http://www.chycor.co.uk/holidays/cycling-in-cornwall/camel-trail/camel-trail.htm "Camel Trail").</li><br /><li>Fishing for crabs off Padstow harbour.</li><br /><li>A brilliant day finding [The Lost Gardens of Heligan](http://www.heligan.com/ "The Lost Gardens of Heligan").</li><br /><li>Loads and loads and loads of other things.</li> <br />
