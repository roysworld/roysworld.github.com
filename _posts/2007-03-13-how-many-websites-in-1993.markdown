title: How Many Websites in 1993
---
Interesting fact of the day: According to [Wanderer, the first autonomous agent on the web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Wanderer), used to track web growth since 1993, in June 1993 there were only 130 websites. The guy who wrote Wanderer now works for Google.
