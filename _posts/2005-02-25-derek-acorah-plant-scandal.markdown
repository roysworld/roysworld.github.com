title: Derek Acorah Plant Scandal?
---
Read Brendan Kilmartin's article from [The Supernatural World](http://www.thesupernaturalworld.co.uk). It asks the question "did Derek Acorah use UK Psychic Medium Simon Peters as a plant at the York Opera House Theatre?". Compare [Brendan Kilmartin's evidence](http://www.thesupernaturalworld.co.uk/index.php?code=02&file=derek_acorah.php&title=Derek%20Acorah%20/%20Simon%20Peters%20Scandal!&cat=submitted_articles) with [Simon Peters response](http://www.thesupernaturalworld.co.uk/index.php?code=02&file=simon_peters.php&title=A%20message%20from%20Simon%20Peters%20about%20Derek%20Acorah&cat=submitted_articles) and make up your own mind.
