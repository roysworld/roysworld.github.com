title: 1st day at school

Today was Billys first day at infant school. <br /><br />I was working at home - and when he came back at lunchtime he was really excited. Apparently he did lots of paintings of bricks for a 3 little pigs brick house and thoroughly enjoyed himself. <br /><br />My little boy is growing up.<br /><br />
