Congratulations to Alan and Sue who are now the proud parents of twins born on 4th August.<br />Matthew Nathan was born at 13:43 weighing 7lb 9oz and Rachel Zoe was born two minutes later weighing 5lb 1oz. <br />I shan't drone on the usual stuff about sleepless nights and nappies, just have a quiet wry smile to myself.
