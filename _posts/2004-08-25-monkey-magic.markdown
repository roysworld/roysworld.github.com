A new series of Monkey Magic started last night on five.<br />Here's what they say about it:
(Britain's Maddest Magicians) Papa, Monkey Boy, Tufty and The Colonel return to perform amazing tricks with the strangest stuff in the weirdest places. Once again they'll be doing magic naked; fooling the public on hidden cameras and surprising unsuspecting celebrities.rn
Here's what I say about it:
(Britain's Maddest Magicians) Papa, Monkey Boy, Tufty and The Colonel return to recycle standard textbook tricks in a not very original way.

I must say I'm a little disappointed with these lot. I thought the last series was OK, but judging by the 1st episode this series is far from exciting. Most of the tricks were performed well, but I saw nothing new or original. Performing the [Linking Rings](http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=809&awinaffid=45161&p=http://www.world-of-magic.co.uk/magic.asp?id=267) in a phonebox is hardly awe inspiring, and OK doing magic in the dark is vaguely interesting but could they not have picked a better trick than torn and restored cigarette paper?
rnI will watch the rest and hope it improves.rnrn
