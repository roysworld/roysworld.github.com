title: Kreed Kafer == Derek Faker
---
A week or so ago I was contacted by Emma who is one of the researchers of [Bad Psychics](http://www.badpsychics.co.uk/). She explained she was setting up a [new site](http://www.doublexposure.co.uk/) "aimed at exposing Most Haunted, Most Haunted Live and Derek Acorah amongst others". She was interested in publishing [my account of an Evening with Derek Acorah](http://roysworld.co.uk/?p=2705) and of course I agreed.<br /><br />The site is still new and evolving, but it does have a few [interesting articles about Mr Acorah](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/isil.telemnar/Doublexposure/derek_acorah_menu.htm). <br /><br />My favourite is about the first episode of series 6 of Most Haunted. The episode aired on Living TV last week and was set in Bodmin Gaol. You can read the full transcript [here](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/isil.telemnar/Doublexposure/Kreed%20Kafer.htm), but in summary the article purports to have evidence that Derek was completely stitched up. In one section of the show, Derek is seen to be 'possessed' by a South African Jailor called Kreed Kafer. According to the article the name was made up by a couple of people on set, and talked about within earshot of Derek. The punchline is of course that Kreed Kafer is an anagram of Derek Faker. The author then sent an email to the head of Living TV quoting the [Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951](http://www.corvardus.f9.co.uk/religion/wicca/witch1951.htm) proposing that Derek should be sacked.<br /><br />Other articles of interest consider [the origins of Derek's name](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/isil.telemnar/Doublexposure/doublexposure_acorah_exposed.htm) and why [medium Thomas Alder believes Derek Acorah is faking it](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/isil.telemnar/Doublexposure/acora_on_stage.htm).Finally, here is the [Daily Mirror article ](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16303507&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=spooky-truth--name_page.html)where Ciaran O'Keeffe finally reveals how he tricked Derek.
