The Manchester Evening News [reports](http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1362174_selfridges_pay_frank_sidebottoms_family_10000_after_christmas_window_gaffe) that Selfridge's current Christmas display contains figures bearing an uncanny likeness to the sorely missed Frank Sidebottom.

I'm pleased to say that Selfridge's have given £10,000 to the Sievey family as payment for use of the image, some of which will be donated to charity.
