title: Derren Brown Safety Tips
---
I've noticed a lot more chatter about Derren from "over the pond" recently, as it appears the Americans are starting to notice him. [needcoffee.com](http://needcoffee.com) has published ["7 Safety Tips For Dealing With Derren Brown"](http://www.needcoffee.com/2007/05/01/7-safety-tips-for-dealing-with-derren-brown/) that made me laugh. The article has justification for each tip, but in summary they are:- Don't deal with Derren Brown.
- Don't go to the United Kingdom.
- If you suddenly find yourself in the UK, and Derren approaches, don't look at him.
- If you cannot escape him, do not let him touch you.
- If he manages to touch you, At least keep him from taking hold of your wrist.
- If he manages to take hold of your wrist, for the love of baby Jesus don't let him put your hand over your face.
- Even if he doesn't touch you, don't let him not touch you either.
