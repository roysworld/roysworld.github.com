title: del.icio.us tips

I've been using [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) for a while now. For the uninitiated it's an online bookmark tool, allowing you to store bookmarks in a global way, [tagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags) them for later recovery.  It's pretty useful actually (it's what I use to generate my "Looking At" links - amongst other things) and it's not going to go away as Yahoo have just acquired it.Ok so why am I suddenly blogging about it. Well, firstly I should have mentioned it ages ago, and secondly [Slacker Manager](http://slackermanager.com) has written a brilliant article entitled [The Several Habits of Wildly Successful del.icio.us users](http://www.slackermanager.com/slacker_manager/2005/12/the_several_hab.html). It's well worth a read.
