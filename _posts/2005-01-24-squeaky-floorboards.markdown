title: Squeaky Floorboards
---
We are trying to sell our house, so this weekend I decided I would finally put pay to a number of squeaky floorboards on the landing; so cordless drill at the ready I proceeded to screw the offending boards down. I had finished, and was walking around testing for squeaks when one of the boards creaked under my weight (understandable some might say, but that's another story).<br /><br />I knelt down, and screwed a nice silver screw into the board, whereupon I was squirted in the eye by three foot of water.<br /><br />I had screwed right into a copper pipe. At this point a large volley of swear words were unleashed, and I proceeded to:<br />1. Turn off the water<br />2. Turn on the hot taps to empty the tank/boiler<br /><br />The water carried on coming, so I ripped up the floorboard, yes the one I had just spent 1/2 hour screwing to the floor so that it would never move again, and managed to suppress the flow with my thumb. <br /><br />Fortunately one of our neighbours used to be a plumber, and between him and the landlord of my local boozer, he manager to repair the pipe. Thanks a LOT Darren.AD8<br /><br />Anyway, I've managed to re board the floor and put everything back to normal.<br /><br />I went to bed last night, walked along the landing, and you guessed it "squeak, squeak, squeak..."
