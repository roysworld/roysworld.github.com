My mate [James](http://thebloomers.vox.com/) has just got a story of his published in online magazine [Spacesuits and Sixguns](http://www.spacesuitsandsixguns.com/). It's a funny tale of corporate fascism told in a sequence of emails and letters beginning with an incorrect supermarket order. [Have a read](http://www.spacesuitsandsixguns.com/letterofcomplaint.html), but beware if you don't use Windows - you won't be able to read the punchline.
