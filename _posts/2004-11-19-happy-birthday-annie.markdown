title: Happy Birthday Annie
---
Today my little girl is 2 years old. <br />Happy Birthday to you. <br />She's really enjoyed it so far - she loves her babies new crib and the doll Billy got her (it has real hair - as Billy keeps reminding us). Both sets of Grandparents are set to join us later - so the day should prove busy.<br /><br />Things that happened on 19 November:<br /> <br />1600: Charles I, who believed the king ruled by divine right, but lost his head after the Civil War, was born in Fife.<br />1620: The Mayflower arrived off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with the first pioneer settlers.<br />1828: Franz Schubert, Austrian composer, died in Vienna of typhus, aged 31. His last words were: �Here, here is my end.�<br />1863: Abraham Lincoln made his famous Gettysburg address, with his freedom cry: �Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.�<br />1942: The Russians counter-attacked at Stalingrad and surrounded the German army.<br />1949: Prince Rainier III was sworn in as the 30th ruling Prince of Monaco.<br />1960: The first vertical take-off aircraft (VTOL) made by the British Hawker Siddeley company was flown for the first time.<br />1984: More than 500 people died and 10,000 homes were destroyed in an explosion at a chemicals factory in Mexico City.<br />1988: �Poor little rich girl� Christina Onassis, daughter of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle, died from a heart attack, aged just 37.<br />1990: Nato and Warsaw Pact members ended the �Cold War� by signing a weapons treaty in Paris.<br />
