A new comedy starts tonight on BBC3 called [High Spirits With Shirley Ghostman](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/shirleyghostman/). It's nicely timed to hook in with increased interest in 'real' psychic mediums such as Derek Acorah. It looks quite funny, she claims she is "one of Britain's leading psychics" and that here "friends are dead famous. Like Lady Diana. And Roy Orbison.". One to watch I think.AD17<br />
