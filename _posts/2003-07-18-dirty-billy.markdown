Last night Billy and me were in the bath playing with water pistols. We had great fun recreating famous gun moments from the movies including "Hasta la vista, baby!", "You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here." and my favourite was Billy's version of Dirty Harry's quote that went "Are you feeling mucky pup? Go ahead, make my day."
