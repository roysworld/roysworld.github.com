title: Ray Harryhausen
---
I've always been a fan of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion effects, and Billy has become a fan too. We've started watching all of the old films again, and here's what we think of the ones we've watched so far (in chronological order).<br /><br /><b>Earth vs The Flying Saucers (1956)</b><br />This is a real B-Movie. That's not always a problem, but the story is pretty diabolical. Effects are good for their day, but there aren't really enough of them, and the actors in rubber alien costumes are terrible. It's a shame Ray wasn't allowed to animate the aliens. The movie tagline was "Warning! Take Cover! Flying Saucers Invade Our Planet! Washington, London, Paris, Moscow Fight Back!". 5/10<br /><br /><b>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958)</b><br />I like this film. The difference in the effects in this one compared to 'Earth vs The Flying Saucers' is amazing, and the story is great too. Animated monsters include: Cyclops, a sword-wielding skeleton, a two-headed Roc and a dragon. Brilliant. 7/10<br /><br /><b>Jason and the Argonauts (1963)</b><br />Definitely my favourite Harryhausen film. Talos is still as scary today as he was when I was 7. We've watched this film over and over. As a kid I remember watching open mouthed as Poseidon appeared in the sea holding open the 'Clashing Rocks'. 9/10<br />
