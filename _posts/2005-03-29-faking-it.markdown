title: Faking It
---
Last night I watched a taped copy of Sundays C4 episode of 'Faking It'. It was brilliant. Nerdy Physicist Kevin McMahon transformed from geeky science student to table hopping magician. Highlights included him being thrown in at the deep-end and having to perform some tricks in front of Penn and Teller (he completely cocked it up, leaving Penn looking somewhat bored and unimpressed), doing a 5 minute standup slot at a gay comedy club and the realisation on his face that saying he was a magician was a real girl-puller. This meant he no longer had to resort to using his 'lucky' jumper that from what we gathered gave him a little success with a girl, sort of, once. In the end he completely fooled the expert panel (including Paul Daniels no less), and he loved it so much that he immediately quit his physics phd to become a full time magician. Afterwards I was all ready to give up being a geeky IT consultant and becoming a full time table-hopping magician too until Paula pointed out how many tables I would have to 'hop' to pay the mortgage. Maybe I should practice more.
