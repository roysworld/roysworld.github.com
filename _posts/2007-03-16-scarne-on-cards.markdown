title: Scarne On Cards
---

I've had one of John Scarne's books on my shelf for years; covering the rules of most card games  as well as covering some of the basic cheats. This video shows the man himself showing some classic sleights. Don't be fooled, these are difficult card sleights demonstrated by a master, and it's just great seeing them performed by John himself.
