title: Acorah Meets Doctor Who
---
Can you believe it: Derek Acorah has a guest role in the new series of Doctor Who (thanks [BDO](http://bigdumbobject.co.uk)) [SFX](http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/haunted_who) quotes an interview for the Manchester Evening News where Derek says he has "just filmed Doctor Who" where "The Doctor finds that spirits and ghosts have invaded the whole of the galaxy so he gets me along to see what we can do about it".Weird stuff. The scene - inside some spaceship, all filmed in green-middle-of-the-night-oh-vision. The Doctor looks sceptical with a clipboard, and taking readings with his Sonic Screwdriver. Rose looking bored finally glances up at Derek, and says :"What can you see Derek? Can Sam see anything?"Derek - finger pointing from forehead starts marching around:     "Ex?     Exter?     Ex-Ter-Min-Ate.     What does that mean Sam?"
