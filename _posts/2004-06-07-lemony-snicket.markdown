title: Lemony Snicket

Paramount are filming Lemony Snicket's "A Series Of Unfortunate Events". I loved this book - really dark and frankly quite scary for kids. They have released the [trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/lemony_snickets/large.html "trailer") and it looks quite good. <br />One thing bugs me though. Can't Hollywood find anyone other than Jim Carrey to do these films?
