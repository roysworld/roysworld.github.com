At the weekend we had a Dads and Kids weekend away camping. Me and four other Dads plus kids headed down to Swanage and found a [campsite](http://www.ukcampsite.co.uk/sites/details.asp?revid=1237 "campsite") near the [Herston Halt railway station](http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/ "Herston Halt railway station"). This meant that after we had put up the tents, we could catch a steam train down to the beach. We had brilliant weather and a great time building sandcastles, catching crabs (well one actually), having fish chips and beer in a licensed chipshop and winning Shrek2 toys out of those 'grabber' arcade machines that are meant to be impossible but for some reason I always manage to win. Billy thought it was great and he slept like a log snuggled up in his sleeping bag. I had a less comfortable nights sleep when I realised that not being able to move any limbs in a 'mummy' type sleeping bag is only acceptable when you are in a drunken stupor (as I would have been last time I slept in it). I must get a more rectangle sleeping bag before next time. As always cooking bacon and sausages for breakfast was a winner, they always test fantastic when outside, so much so that Billy reckons I am the 'best cooker in the World'.  Roll on the next camping expedition, we're trying to decide if Annie is old enough to rough it yet.
