title: Telegraph Reviews Derren
---
I have just finished reading Charles Spencer's review of the Something Wicked This Way Comes Tour on the Telegraph Arts website. Interestingly his take on the show is in complete contrast to mine. He likes what I didn't and is not impressed by what startled me. Read [his ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/06/07//btderren07.xml&sSheet=/arts/2005/06/07/ixartleft.html) review and then read [mine](http://roysworld.co.uk/?p=2735). Afterwards go and see the show and decide for yourself. I promise you will like it.
