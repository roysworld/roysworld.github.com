title: Guinness for the un-initiated
---
Being a seasoned Guinness drinker both in the UK and Ireland, I have no need for this [guide to buying Guinness in an Irish pub](http://www.ivo.se/guinness/beginner.html), however any UK Guinness drinkers planning on a trip over the water may find it enlightening. I particularly liked the bit about determining nationality of the drinker by the number of rings left on the glass "An Irishman will have in the region of 5-6 rings (we pace ourselves), an Englishman will have 8-10 rings, an American will have 17-20 (they sip) and an Australian won't have any at all as they tend to knock it back in one go!"
