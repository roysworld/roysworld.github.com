So [will.i.am](http://twitter.com/iamwill) is going to [learn to code](http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/william-is-going-back-to-school-to-study-1259968). 

Here's what he's got to say on the matter:

> Next year I am going to school to take a computer science course.

> When I am 57 I still want to be relevant in popular culture and the way to be relevant within popular culture in the future is writing code.

> Code writers, they are my idols. Songwriters are cool – I can write songs, too – and bloggers are cool but code writers? Those are the coolest in the world.

> When I was 17 I had a dream and all the dreams I have had since 17 I have done them beyond what I thought I was ever going to do.

> So now I want to go back to school and learn how to write code so I can participate in this whole new era that we are in.

> Writing songs is dope but writing code is better.
