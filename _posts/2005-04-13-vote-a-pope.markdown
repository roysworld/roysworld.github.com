title: Vote a Pope
---
An [Irish bookmaker is taking bets on who the next Pope should be.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437469.stm) The favourite is Cardinal Francis Arinze with odds of 3-1. Odds are also 3-1 that the new Pope will be known as Pope Benedict. <br />I think there should be a new reality tv show allowing us all to phone vote for our favourite with the winner becoming Pope. The name of this show? Why Pope Idol of course!
