![Billy's Party](http://www.roysworld.co.uk/roysworld/uploaded_images/20030705.162258-blog.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br />Yesterday was Billy's 4th birthday. My little boy is growing up...<br /><br /><br /><br />The day began with a rather rapid unwrapping of his presents. It reminded me of Edward Scissorhands cutting hair - but with strips of wrapping paper flying everywhere. He then moved onto opening cards which began in a rather civilised way with Billy saying things like "...oooww a cat with a fishing rod" and "...aaah a cuddly bear". This soon ended once he realised some of them also contained fivers - we then moved into a truly capitalist hunt for money with scant regard to the birthday cards containing it. All the cash he got was notes making the hunt trickier. When I was a kid any money I got for my birthday was always coins and so you could tell before opening whether the card in question would be financially rewarding.<br /><br /><br /><br />At 3.00pm eight of Billies school mates arrived for Billy's party. All parents left at 3.01pm leaving us to keep the unruly four year-olds under control for two hours. The party went really well with the kids generally doing what they wanted in the garden. This was punctuated by a couple of preplanned games. <br /><br /><br /><br />We started with a "pin the patch on the pirate" game won by Freya (4) - who also helped entertain us adults by singing American Pie in Billy's microphone - sure makes a change from the usual Wheels on the Bus and Wind the Bobbin Up. Next came the obligatory pass the parcel won by Ben. We finished with a pirate treasure hunt with several clues, each leading to the next. One hidden in a sand castle another under a slide, you get the idea, culminating with a box of treasure full of necklaces, jewels, badges and dozens of chocolate coins. I would highly recommend this as a way to finish a kids party as everybody wins and there are no long faces from the losers. <br /><br /><br /><br />We managed to survive the party and I really enjoyed it too! I must brush up on my childrens magic for next year.
