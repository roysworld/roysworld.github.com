We've just return from a 4 night break at Moores Farm in Somerset; it's a ["Featherdown Farm"](http://www.featherdownfarm.co.uk/) which means you stay in one of their tents pictured above. Now I say tent, but they're really more like a log cabin with canvas roof and sides. It can sleep six, has running (cold) water, a toilet, and wood-burning stove that you can use to boil up water and cook on. In the center of our group of tents (there are only five and they're spread apart) was a paddock with a few hens, goats and sheep. The kids loved chasing the animals and searching for eggs: so much so that we had plenty to do at the farm that we didn't bother with our trips to Longleat and Cheddar (including a good hour spent chasing a tricky sheep that the kids let out of the paddock). We cooked all the meals on the stove (that was fun in itself) and had a fantastic time. My only regret was that we didn't stay for the week. We will definitely be back next year, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with kids.
