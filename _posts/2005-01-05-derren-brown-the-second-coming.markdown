title: Derren Brown The Second Coming
---
Derren Brown is attempting to take on the Church in the USA. In the new series 'Messiah', Channel 4: Friday, January 7 2005 (22:35 - 23:40), Derren approaches spiritual leaders and attempts to convince them he is new new Messiah using his standard mind control methods. <br /><br />Derren says "Messiah is a documentary-style show where I go to America and get to meet those influential people behind certain belief-systems. Two targets are new-age beliefs and mainstream Christianity."<br /><br />"Can I get those people who are responsible for the beliefs of hundreds of thousands of people, to endorse me as being the real thing?"<br /><br />I reckon he has every chance.
