![Battle of the Planets](http://melaman2.com/cartoons/singles/stills/B/battle-planets1.jpg "Battle of the Planets")<br />Check out [Mike' Classic Cartoon Themes &amp; Images](http://melaman2.com/cartoons/index2.html) to download mp3's of classic cartoon theme music. My favourites are [Battle of the Planets](http://melaman2.com/cartoons/singles/battle.html), [The Banana Splits](http://melaman2.com/cartoons/singles/banana.html), [Spider-Man](http://melaman2.com/cartoons/singles/spiderman67.html) and [Wait Till Your Father Gets Home](http://melaman2.com/cartoons/singles/wait.html). Absolutely brilliant. My Squeezebox has a new genre.
