title: Hot Discovery
---
The weekend was hot. Damn hot. In fact it was record breakingly hot as temperatures reached 38.1C (100.6F). The kids found it difficult to sleep, and so did we. So we basically spent the weekend hunting out air-conditioned areas (the car, ELC, John Lewis) and tried to avoid the direct heat as much as possible. I hate complaining about sunny days, but when you have tired, hot and bothered kids not to mention us, everything becomes difficult. <br /><br />Annie is now into everything and can crawl from one end of our front room to the other in a few seconds. She of course is obsessed with the VCR; why do kids find them so fascinating? She also learned to clap, putting it to good effect congratulating herself on blowing enormous raspberries.<br /><br />We did however make it to the [Lookout discovery centre](http://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/lookout/index.htm "Lookout discovery centre") and it was fantastic. We took a picnic that we ate in a really nice spot by the side of the childrens play area. Inside the discovery centre are numerous hands on science experiments and as you can imagine this was right up Billy's street. It comes with our seal of approval - and I guarantee that we'll go back soon.
