![Hereford Russet](http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0zwUEEMv2LqEPqbOmybc9-Cwh1hM6_DKIPNlP6LTO0Z-XNMI&t=1&usg=__6t5tpxqFKmK5oLf2_7mdY9ShaIU=)Had a knock on the door from the local apple expert this morning.He had heard we had a Hereford Russet tree in our garden, and wanted a sample for an apple exhibition next week. I didn't know we had a Hereford Russet, so I I'm not sure how he did.Village life can be very strange sometimes.
