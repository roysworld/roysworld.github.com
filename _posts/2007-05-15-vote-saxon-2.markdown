There is a lot of buzz about Doctor Who at the moment as to who Mister Saxon is. We know he is to be played by John Simm, and has been name-dropped more times than Tom Jones name-drops Elvis. Mister Saxon is an anagram of "Master No Six", so is he the Master? (there is debate as to whether there have or haven't been five previous Masters) Several Vote Saxon sites have popped up, and you can even [buy Vote Saxon tshirts](http://www.cafepress.com/votesaxon). Is this the worst kept secret since the cybermen? We will soon see (assuming there is no further disruption by footy and song contests).<div>[![Vote Saxon](http://www.roysworld.co.uk/extra/images/votesaxontshirt.jpg)](http://www.cafepress.com/votesaxon)</div>
