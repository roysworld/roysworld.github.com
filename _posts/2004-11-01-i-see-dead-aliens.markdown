title: I See Dead Aliens
---
What a weekend it has been for Most Haunted Live at Pendle Hill Lancashire.<br /><br />According to the [Lancashire Tourism Partnership](http://www.lancashiretourism.com/pendle.asp?source=adwords) <i>"History and legend has woven a spell over Pendle. Pendle Hill rises above this ancient hunting ground, once the home of wolves and wild boar and to this day dotted with tiny hamlets and farms. It is still an untamed place, full of mystery and infamous as the home of the Pendle Witches who were tried and executed for witchcraft in 1612."</i>.<br /><br />So far (and there is another edition tonight at 9pm on [Living TV](http://www.livingtv.co.uk/mosthaunted) and I can't wait) Derek Acorah and the crew have excelled themselves. Here are some of the highlight that made me laugh. <br /><br />Derek Acorah saw the ghost of an alien; in fact not just any alien, a 'grey'. This was pointed out solemnly by the other medium back in the studio. When asked what he thought of Derek's revelation, this other medium said that he thought it was "brave" of Derek to mention this. For "brave" read "he's really pushing is luck now". This is on a par from the time he ranted on about seeing subterranians in a london Tube Station.<br /><br />Richard Felix was "really impressed" (isn't he always) by Dereks revelation that Elizabeth Southerns was also known as Demdike; particularly as this information is hard to find. Yes it sure is. Took me 10 minutes to find [this site](http://www.pendlewitches.co.uk/) that says <i>"Elizabeth Southerns, alias Demdike, died in Lancaster Gaol awaiting trial..."</i> I guess its harder to find this in his dusty old books.<br /><br />Derek Acorah got possessed about three times by different witches. When Matthew Smith (resident sceptic) was asked what he thought of Derek's possessions he said "One interpretation could be that he was just play-acting". This was followed by boos and much eye rolling from the other medium". <br /><br />The show ended with a bit of table tipping and a seance with an upturned glass. The glass was whizzing around the table apparently being moved by the Wicked Witch Elizabeth Southerns (or perhaps Derek, or producer Karl). Then suddenly the cast started dropping like flies. First one of the sound crew thought he was being strangled, then Stuart (Paula's favorite) got strangled and collapsed. Then the makeup girl and finally we lost all footage as the camera man was attacked. This really reminded me of [GhostWatch](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/tv/ghostwatch/) which was a spoof haunted show broadcast in 1992. I have no idea what was going on but it was great TV. Maybe they are trying to get some publicity so they can be moved to a real tv station?<br /><br />Roll on tonights installment, I'm sure it will be great. I'm having a sweepstake on how many times Derek will get possessed.<br />
