title: Spider-Man 3 - The Alien Costume
---
The following teaser picture has been released for the upcoming 2007 blockbuster Spider-Man 3:![Spider-Man - Black Costume](http://spiderman.sonypictures.com/images/spider-man.jpg)When I showed it to our resident Spider-Man expert Billy he pointed out this could mean only one thing - [Venom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_%28comics%29). He went on to explain how Spider-Man's black costume is actually an [alien symbiote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_%28comics%29) and that Spider-Man manages to free himself from it by going to a bell-tower (alien symbiote's hate loud noises), and that it then merges with Eddie Brock to become Venom.  Hardly seems worth watching the movie now.
