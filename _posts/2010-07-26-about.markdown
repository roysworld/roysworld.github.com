title: "About Roiz W\xFBrld"

<blockquote>**Roys (roiz)** - Of or relating to Roy.**World (wûrld) **A part of the earth and its inhabitants as known at a given period in history.  A sphere of human activity or interest.</blockquote>RoysWorld is the definitive guide to all things Roy.It's my hastily put together scribblings of thoughts, beliefs and meaningless trivia.I tend to talk about stuff I like: technology, retro, magic and illusion, cookery and being a father and stuff that gets on my nerves: religion, spiritualism, football and being a father. If you are bored or offended, may I suggest you change the channel and try [Sanders The Great](http://sandersthegreat.co.uk)Oh, and don't confuse this with [RoyWorld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royworld) the band, as that is something completely different.
