title: New Gadgets

I have recently acquired 2 new gadgets. <br /><br />The first is a [Philips Pronto](http://www.pronto.philips.com/index.cfm?id=271 "Philips Pronto"). It's a cool touchscreen programmable remote control. It has a good editing suite that lets you design the layout and design macros for controlling ir devices (for instance - turn on the vcr - select channel 3 - start recording). I our front room we currently have 5 remote controls - TV,Digital Box,DVD,2 VCRS - and with kids this is a BAD idea as each evening we play hunt the remote. Now we have just 1 remote control - and no chance of the grandparents understanding it!<br /><br />My other gadget was kindly contributed to me by a mate at work. It's called a [Multitainer](http://www.thenerdherd.co.uk/ "Multitainer") and was sold by Fujitsu a few years back as a multimedia centre. It's basically a PC in a DVD style case - has a 10gb disk, graphics, network card, sound card and a dvd player. It only runs '98 and the graphics cards aren't supported by anything later. It did come with a IR keyboard and remote - but these are missing. I plan to try to get a keyboard for it from ebay (make do with a USB one for now) and use my Pronto to replace the remote. I'm hoping to install a mini-linux distro on it and use it in the front room to do the following:<br />Be a front end to [MythTv](http://www.mythtv.org/ "MythTv") (A cool open source PVR) that I already have running on my server.<br />Be an mp3 player to my mp3's (on my server)<br />Run [Mame](http://www.mame.net/ "Mame") to allow me to play all those long forgotten arcade games<br />Do anything else I can think of.<br /><br />So much to do and so little time...
