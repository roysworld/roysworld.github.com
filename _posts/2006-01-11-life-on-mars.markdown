title: Life on Mars
---
We were looking through our PVR recordings last night to decide what to watch on TV (we so rarely watch live TV these days), and thought we'd watch BBC1's Life on Mars. We nearly didn't record this as I'd decided I couldn't be bothered to start a new Sci-Fi series, what with Channel 4's Invasion and ITV2's Surface just starting. Just as my finger hovered on the delete key Paula convinced me to leave it for the time being and I'm really glad we did: the first episode was a stonker. If you've missed what it's about [the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lifeonmars/episodeguide.shtml) has (as usual) got loads of info and clips to watch. To summarise though: DCI John Simm is in the middle of a murder enquiry when he gets hit by a car. He awakes in 1973, still a copper and now withc a team investigating a very similar murder to the one he left back in 2006. He hears voices suggesting he's in a coma and imagining it all; but is he? I had been concerned that the show would be a bit too naff and play up to the seventies too much, but I reckon they've got the balance just right. I can't wait until next weeks episode. Check it out BBC Monday's 9.00.
