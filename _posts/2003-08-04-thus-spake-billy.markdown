title: Thus spake Billy
---
Billy got his lego out on Saturday and started constructing things. <br /><br />He's quite imaginative and it's always quite interesting discovering what he has built. He finished what he was doing (some kind of vehicle) and so Paula asked him what he'd made. <br /><br />"What have you made Billy?"<br />"A skidoo. It has three wheels and a steering wheel."<br />"...and what are those white bits on the back?"<br />"They are for knocking down ginormous hills. They are called ginormous knockers"<br /><br />As you can imagine, myself and Paula fell about laughing, but the funniest bit was the serious look on Billy's face as he had no idea what we were laughing at.
