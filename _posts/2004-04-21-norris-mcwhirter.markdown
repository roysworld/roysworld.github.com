Norris McWhirter [died today](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3643039.stm "died today"). When I mentioned this to a colleague at work he didn't know who he was. When I mentioned ["Record Breakers"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-nireland/A794775 "Record Breakers") he replied "Oh you mean that TV show with Kris Akabusi in it?".<br /><br />I am feeling old.
