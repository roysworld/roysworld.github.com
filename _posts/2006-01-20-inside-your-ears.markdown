title: Inside Your Ears
---
OK. This is weird. The members of the Official Derren Brown Forum have created a music CD called [Inside Your Ears](http://www.insideyourears.co.uk) dedicated to their favourite bearded mentalist. The CD is available for [download](http://www.insideyourears.co.uk/download.html) and includes such classics as "12 Bar Brown", "Loaded Gun" and my personal favourite "Yo Derren". You can't make it up.![Cover](http://www.insideyourears.co.uk/images/banner.jpg)
