title: Derren Brown - The Modern Mentalist
---
Just found an interesting article in the [Fortean Times](http://www.forteantimes.com) archives entitled [The Modern Mentalist](http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/185_derren1.shtml). It's an article from FT 185 first published in July 2004, and it's a good read. Jack Phoenix meets Derren at his home to "discuss perception, illusion and spoon- bending."
