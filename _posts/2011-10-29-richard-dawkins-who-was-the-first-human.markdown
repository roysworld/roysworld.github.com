title: "Richard Dawkins: Who Was the First Human?"
---
We attended a lecture given by Richard Dawkins yesterday. 
I was lucky to meet him briefly afterwards in the theatre bar and we talked about dinosaurs and the [Royal Institution Christmas lecture he gave in 1991](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_Up_in_the_Universe).
In the lecture he was reading extracts from his new book "The Magic of Reality" an accessible book aimed at children 
and he described a great thought experiment from the chapter titled: "Who Was the First Human?". 

Here's a re-presentation of the same ideas recorded at a reading in New York:

In a Q&A session after the reading on audience member suggested that all schools should have this book on their bookshelves. 
What a great idea. Maybe I should buy them a copy?
