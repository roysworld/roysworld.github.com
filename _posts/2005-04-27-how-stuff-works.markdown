title: How Stuff Works
---
I've just discovered this great site that tells you how stuff works. It's called [HowStuffWorks.](http://howstuffworks.com)<br /><br />In just three minutes I've found the following gems:<br /><b><br />[Can flour explode?](http://science.howstuffworks.com/question150.htm)<br />[The true story behind The Amityville Horror](http://stuffo.howstuffworks.com/amityville1.htm)<br />[What causes an ice cream headache?](http://science.howstuffworks.com/question96.htm)<br /></b><br /><br />This is an essential resource when you've got a five year-old.
