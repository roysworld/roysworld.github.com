title: Derren Lives
---
Last night Derren Brown performed a russian roulette illusion live (well almost live - I understand there was a time delay) on channel 4. He picked a member of the public from 12000 volunteers and the nervous guy put a bullet in a .45 - counted from 1 to 6 - and Derren correctly predicted that he had put it in chamber 1. Oh, and he did this by firing the gun repeatedly at his head until he got to the live one.<br />Apparently the police are now worried about copycats and said "we're possibly going to end up with some tragedies". Personally I'm hoping for David Copperfield.
