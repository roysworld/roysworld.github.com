Now I've been a bit of a fan of [Frank Sidebottom](http://franksidebottom.co.uk) for sometime since seeing him doing his Freddie Mercury sometime in 1990 (oh yes I have, I really have). I remember meeting him once a few years later playing pinball in the [Jug of Ale in Moseley](http://www.jugofale.com) before a gig (without his head on of course). He hasn't had much press of late, but when I spotted him knocking about on the [Peter Kay Comic Relief video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEMYYNLbEtw) I thought I'd have a quick google and see what he's up to now. He now has a show (Frank Sidebottoms proper telly show) on [Channel M](http://www.channelm.co.uk/programmes/index/0/66/frank_sidebottoms_proper_telly_show.html) which (unfortunately) is only available in the Manchester area, although the shows can be watched online. 

Franks real name is Chris Sievey and here are some facts about him. He was in a punk band called the [Freshies](http://punkmodpop.free.fr/freshies_pic.htm) who hit the charts with a single called ["I'm in love with the girl on the Manchester Virgin megastore.."](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000B125/roysworld0e-21). He wrote a classic game for the speccy called ["The Biz"](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekplay.cgi?title=Biz%2c+The&pub=Virgin+Games+Ltd&year=1984&id=0000544&game=/games/b/BizThe.z80.zip&emu=3) and was [interviewed for Crash magazine](http://www.crashonline.org.uk/15/sievey.htm) issue 15 1985. In the nineties he wrote an episode of Pingu called "Bedtime Shadows". He has a [MySpace account](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=52675576) and there are plenty of clips on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=frank+sidebottom&search=Search). My favourite is this one where two guys meet Chris (without head) on the metro and ask him "who is Frank Sidebottom?"
