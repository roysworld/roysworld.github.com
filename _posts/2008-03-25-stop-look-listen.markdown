title: Stop, Look and Listen 1981
---

When I was about ten a television crew came to my Primary school to film us making paper for an episode of Stop, Look and Listen for ATV. The programme was aimed at schools and had Chris Tarrant doing the voice over. Our episode was about paper, showing how it was made and how books were put together. The scenes with my class showed us making paper from recycled newspaper (we we so ahead of our time!) and hanging up linked paper chains.

I remember us sitting in the school hall watching the episode on the large TV, and I also remember seeing a repeat of it when I was off school ill one time. This was before we had video recorders and so that was the last I saw of it....up until last night!

I've googled before for this episode and failed miserably, but last night up popped a link to youtube and sure enough[ there was the episode ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnobvYN6BDY)_[**Note**: since posting this, the original disappeared from YouTube, and so I have uploaded a copy]_.

The whole episode runs for just ten minutes, and the bit with my school starts at 8:08. Here are the screenshots with me on it and highlights.
## 8:41 A sign of the times "Union Call For All Out At Leyland"
