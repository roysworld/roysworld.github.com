Now I've talked before about [MAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME) before and how I'd like to to have a retro space invaders cabinet myself. Some bloke (has to be a bloke) has gone and built the most amazing [MAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME) console that looks like the TARDIS and has a website that shows you [how he did it, and how to build your own](http://www.asciimation.co.nz/tardis/).
