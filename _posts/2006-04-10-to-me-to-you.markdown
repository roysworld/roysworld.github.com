We took the kids to see the latest Chucklebrothers show at the weekend: "Doctor What and the Invasion of the Garlics". It had the expected "end of the pier" humour that you come to expect from them> There was an unfortunately long: "What's you name", "Yes thats right", "No What's your name", "What's my name", "Yes", "What" sketch that certainly outstayed its welcome. There were some seriously funny bits though including an incident with a ketchup bottle and impecable timing; and a humerous fit of the giggles when Paul accidentally said "that bloody baguette".  As usual, they were joined on stage with their other brothers - the Patton Brothers. All in all a really nice day out, and we even got to meet them at the end.
