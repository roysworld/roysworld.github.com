title: Kids do Raiders
---
Some kids back in 1981 put together a [shot by shot remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark](http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=15348). Looking at the [trailer](http://www.drafthouse.com/trailers/raiders.mov) it looks fantastic - and brings back heady days of running around with a length of rope for a whip pretending to Indiana Jones. It seems only yesterday the excitement of going to see it for my mate Jonathans birthday. I was 10 and remember thinking the 'melting' scene was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. I'm sure the Citizen Kane like ending is the root of my cynical distrust of government and authority.
