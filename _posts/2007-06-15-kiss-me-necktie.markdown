Another classic advert from modern mechanix....by day a lovely swank tie in special color combinations to look smart with any suit, and at night like a miracle of light it leaps to life with pulsing, glowing question— “Will You Kiss Me In The Dark, Baby?” Think of the fun in any crowd! Think how the girls gasp with wonder as the question takes form so amazingly.
