title: The Windy Day
---
_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day._

The washing on the washing line blowing all around,

Trees are swaying as birds are saying "Our nests keep falling to the ground!"

_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day._

The clouds cause a traffic jam as they whizz by,

Leaves blow madly as people say sadly "Our umbrellas are trying to fly!"

_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day._

Hair gets tangled as the wind goes whooooooosh!

Litter swirls and then it twirls on its way down the road in a rush.

_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day_

But I'm all right, snuggled up tight,

I've put up my feet, watched tv, 

Now I'll put the kettle on and have a cup of tea!

( A poem by Annie aged 8 )
