title: The Windy Day
---
( A poem by Annie aged 8 )_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day._The washing on the washing line blowing all around,Trees are swaying as birds are saying “Our nests keep falling to the ground!”_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day._The clouds cause a traffic jam as they whizz by,Leaves blow madly as people say sadly“Our umbrellas are trying to fly!”_It's a windy day, windy day, windy day._Hair gets tangled as the wind goes whooooooosh!Litter swirls and then it twirlsOn its way down the road in a rush._It's a windy day, windy day, windy day_But I'm all right, snuggled up tight,I've put up my feet, watched tv,Now I'll put the kettle on and have a cup of tea!
