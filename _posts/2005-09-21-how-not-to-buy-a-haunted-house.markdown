title: how not to buy a haunted house
---
I you are worried about buying a property that is haunted there is an e-document available just for you. ['The Art And Science Of Spotting Haunted Houses And Detecting Ghostsâ€™](http://www.spottinghauntedhouses.com/shh.html) is available for download, for a price of course. Written by W.S. Chin (nope I don't know who he is either) it sounds like a hilarious read. Here are some quotes from his website, [www.spottinghauntedhouses.com](http://www.spottinghauntedhouses.com/shh.html):<blockquote>OK, you have seen the property and fallen in love with it. This is the one  you've been looking for all your life. The price is right. You're about to  invest your life savings into it. And you're about to sign a mortgage for  perhaps 30 years.  Mighty big investment, you would agree. Perhaps the biggest investment  of your life. But after you've moved in, strange things begin to surface.  Things go bump in the night! There are shadowy figures hovering around  you and your family! You feel invisible, cold fingers touching you!</blockquote><blockquote>I will show you over 60 techniques to interpret those sometimes very subtle signs. I will also reveal to you things that can attract ghosts into your house...things you may have right now! "But can a person really detect ghosts?" If you are in good general health, if you can be silent and listen to your  mind, you can! In my younger days, I was very psychic. I saw dead people!</blockquote><blockquote> Now, how much will such an important document cost? Compared to the  property you're going to buy or rent, NEXT TO NOTHING! I actually would  rather give it away for free! But in the real world, there are overheads to  pay, mouths to feed etc.</blockquote>You really can sell anything.
