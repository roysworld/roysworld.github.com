title: Messenger woes
---
If you use messenger you may have noticed that Microsoft have started sending out the following notification at startup: <i>".NET Messenger Service Staff: You are running a version of messenger that requires an immediate security update. Please visit http://messenger.msn.com/Help/Upgrades.aspx to complete the update."</i> <br /><br />If, like me, you don't use messenger (I use [Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/trillian/ "Trillian") on Windows and [KMess](http://kmess.sourceforge.net/ "KMess") on Linux) this is bad news. On 15th October Microsoft will block all non-upgraded (i.e. non-Microsoft only) users leaving Linux users in the dark and Trillian users somewhat miffed. I'm sure patches will ultimately arrive - but until then we're a bit goosed. <br /><br />Maybe it's time I switched to [ICQ](http://web.icq.com/ "ICQ")?<br /><br />Rant over.
