[![Lego Space Invader](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5241/5254211568_3f402075b0.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roysworld/5254211568/)Billy made this Lego Space Invader tile. I think it's pretty cool, and it got me thinking.What if I replaced the tiles in the bathroom with Lego baseplates? The kids could then decorate the bathroom with Lego art. We could construct shelves to store shampoo and soap, and it would be an ever changing landscape. The opportunities are endless, and we certainly have enough Lego to do it.Genius or lunacy? I'm still undecided.
