title: Atari Reissues Classics

Atari is selling a product called [Atari Flashback](http://www.atari.com/us/games/atari_flashback/7800). It's an all in one games console complete with 7800 style joysticks. Each console contains 15 [Atari 2600](http://retrogamer.merseyworld.com/atari.htm) games and 5 [Atari 7800](http://www.atari7800.org/) games. I think it's a real shame that they didn't make it look like a classic 2600 "woody" and I think they could have been a bit more generous with the number of games.
