I've been hearing about [XGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGL) for a while now, and with the new release of [Windows Vista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista) imminent, I was wondering how it compares. Well, there appears to be no comparison, XGL really rocks! Take a look at the following demo from [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com), and if you want to give it a spin, try and get hold of a copy of [Kororaa](http://kororaa.org/) (I got mine as a [bittorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)). Interestingly, you might assume you need a serious set of graphics cards to run this (I was at a conference this week where someone had 4 graphics cards in his pc!), but apparently not.
