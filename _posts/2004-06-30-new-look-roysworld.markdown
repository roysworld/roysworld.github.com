title: New Look RoysWorld
---
I spent several hours last night upgrading RoysWorld from [b2](http://cafelog.com/) to the latest version of [b2evolution](http://b2evolution.net/).  It looks like b2evo supports a number of new features I will like like multiple blogs, nested categories and a rich support for RSS and Atom. The layout is not how I want it right now, but I will work on that over the next few weeks. I hope you like it.
