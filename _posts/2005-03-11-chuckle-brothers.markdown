title: Chuckle Brothers
---
Last weekend we took the kids to see [the Chuckle Brothers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A242650) in their current production of "Pirates of the River Rother". It was absolutely brilliant. The show was typical panto stuff with Paul and Barry getting into scrapes with evil captains, and was loosely (and I mean loosely!) based upon Pirates of the Carribean". We all had a fab time, and we'll definitely be going to next years tour. Interestingly the bad guys in the show were played by the "Patton Brothers" who are Paul and Barry's older brothers. Also on the show were [Safire](http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_profiles/magicprofile_0030_safire.htm) a boy-girl illusion act that we all enjoyed too. After the show we all got to meet the Chuckle Brothers who were signing stuff in the theatre lobby. Billy got into a bit of "to me, to you" banter with Barry and it made the whole day really special. Highly recommended.
