title: Build Your Own Arcade Cabinet II
---
Just stumbled across [Mame Room](http://www.mameroom.com). This is my kind of site. They sell plans, and assemble-yourself-kits for making Arcade Cabinets. I particularly like the [Ultimate Arcade II Cabinet](http://www.mameroom.com/uaIIplans_info.asp). I've always wanted to have my own [Mame](http://www.mame.net/) based Arcade system, and this site brings me one step nearer. Still might be cheaper (and easier) to buy a second-hand broken arcade game to gut and use, but this site offers some other alternatives. Oh to hear the steady thump of Space Invaders ringing in my ears once again...
