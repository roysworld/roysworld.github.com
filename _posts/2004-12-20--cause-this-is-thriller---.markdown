title: "'Cause This Is Thriller..."
---
Back in the 80's, I really liked the video to Michael Jackson's Thriller. Now I like it again. Why? Someone has done a [shot-by-shot recreation using lego](http://www.koreus.com/files/200408/lego_thriller.html) and it is one of the most amazingly funny things I've ever seen. Wait until you get to the zombie dancing bit, it's incredible. They must do more!
