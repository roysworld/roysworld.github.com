[![Field](http://earth.google.com/images/earth.jpg "Field")](http://earth.google.com/images/earth.jpg)<br />Google has just released [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/). It is a downloadable application that allows you to fly around the earth looking at places and stuff. It's fantastic, especially in areas where they have the full satellite photos. Hook up to a GPS device and plot where you are in the World! This is seriously brilliant stuff. They need a linux version though...<br /><br />Some more screenshots:<br /><br /><center>[![Rome](http://earth.google.com/images/rome_th.jpg "Rome")](http://earth.google.com/images/rome.jpg)    [![Field](http://earth.google.com/images/field_th.jpg "Field")](http://earth.google.com/images/field.jpg)    [![Bahamas](http://earth.google.com/images/bahamas_th.jpg "Bahamas")](http://earth.google.com/images/bahamas.jpg)</center><br /><br />
