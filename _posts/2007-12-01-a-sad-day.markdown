It's a sad day today, as I hear my childhood hero Evel Knievel has died. 

Growing up he was my hero, I would pretend to be him on my hand-me-down Raleigh racer that was far too big for me. OK, so he crashed a lot, but so did I and we both got back on and tried again. I always wanted a stunt-cycle, but we could never afford one. Maybe I'll buy one now as a tribute. 

Goodbye Evel and thanks for being a memory of my childhood.
