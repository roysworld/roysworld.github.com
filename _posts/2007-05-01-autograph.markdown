Billy has just received this autograph from David Tennant courtesy of Molly's Granny and he's over the moon. The BBC filmed a couple of episodes of the current Doctor Who series at their family house [Treberfydd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treberfydd) and they took the trouble to ask for an autograph for Billy. Billy can't thank you enough Rosanne and Roger.
