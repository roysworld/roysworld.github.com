Here's a treat for you: an old cine reel of my family and I dating from about 1973. I recently obtained about 1300 ft (over 2 hours) of cine film from under my Mum and Dads bed. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjya3_hHiLE) is my first attempt and digitizing one of them.

It shows me (as a toddler) with my brother Mark, Mum, Dad and my Granny.
